CSC384 Assignment 1 Astar Questions
Q1. Suppose you want to use A* and you have a heuristic that may overestimate or underestimate
cost to the goal by as much as 20%. Can you do anything to guarantee the algorithm will find
the optimal solution (if one exists)?

A1: A* is optimal if the heuristic never overestimates the cost of the path. You can offset the
20% estimation inaccuracy by linearly scaling the cost (g(n)) of each state/node to increase g(n).
This should be done so that the heuristic h(n) will always underestimate the cost of the path
and the relative difference in cost of g(n) of each state/node is always the same between
states/nodes. Equivelently you could use weighted A* and scale down the heuristic's effect on
the f(n) calculation where f(n) = g(n) + weight*h(n).

Q2. (True or False) Assume you you are playing Lunar Lockout on a board that has three xanadus.
The sum of the Manhattan distances between each xanadu and the exit is an admissible heuristic
for this problem, should you use A-star to solve it.

A2: False.  The sum of the Manhattan distances between each xanadu and the exit is not an admissible
heuristic because cumulative Manhattan distance in almost all situations is greater than moves
required to finish a game therein overestimating the cost. To illustrate this, the cost of every move
is equal to 1 meaning that the lowest possible manhattan distance of 3 xanadus is 3 making it
greater than the cost almost always. You can us A* to solve it with a different heuristic.
